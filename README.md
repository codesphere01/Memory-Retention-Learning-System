# 🧠 Memory Retention Learning System

The Memory Retention Learning System is a learning-support project designed to help students remember what they study for a longer time.

Instead of random revisions, this system focuses on when and what to revise, based on user performance and memory patterns.

The idea is inspired by how human memory works and how information is forgotten over time.

**❓ Why I Built This Project**

Many students study regularly but still forget concepts during exams or interviews.

**Common Problems:**

No proper revision schedule

Revising too late or too early

No tracking of weak vs strong topics

**Solution:**

This system tracks learning behavior and suggests smart, timely revisions to improve long-term retention.

**🎯 What This System Does**

Stores learning topics and study sessions

Calculates memory retention score

Suggests optimal revision time

Shows progress using graphs and charts

**🧩 Main Features**

Topic-wise learning tracking

Retention score calculation

Spaced repetition logic

Learning progress dashboard

Forgetting pattern analysis

**🛠️ Tech Stack**

Frontend

HTML

CSS

JavaScript

Charts for visualization

Backend

Python (Flask / FastAPI)

Data Processing & ML

Libraries

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn (basic models)

Database

MySQL / MongoDB

Visualization

Matplotlib

Power BI

**🧠 How the System Works**

User adds topics to study

User attempts quizzes

System records accuracy and time

Retention score is calculated

Forgetting rate is analyzed

Revision reminder is generated

Dashboard shows learning insights

**📊 Sample Retention Logic**
Retention Score = Accuracy × Revision Frequency × Time Factor


The score increases or decreases based on user performance and revision behavior.

**📌 Applications**

Exam preparation

Interview preparation

Concept revision

Skill learning

Self-study planning

**🧪 Future Scope**

Mobile app version

AI-based personalized tutor

NLP-based concept difficulty detection

Gamification features

Classroom / multi-user mode
